# 📏 End-to-End-SOCR-Height-Weight-Prediction-System

An end-to-end Machine Learning regression project that predicts human weight based on height using a supervised learning model. The model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling real-time predictions through a clean and intuitive interface.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This application demonstrates how Machine Learning can be applied to solve real-world regression problems.
Using height as the input feature, the trained regression model predicts the corresponding weight.

The project covers the complete ML lifecycle:

Data processing

Model training

Model serialization

Web-based deployment

It bridges the gap between ML theory and real-world application.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Predict human weight based on height

Build and deploy a regression model

Create a user-friendly ML web app

Demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

🐍 Python
